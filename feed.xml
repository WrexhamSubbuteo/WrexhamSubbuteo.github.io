        <title>Website Launched</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-fresh-start&quot;&gt;A fresh start&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the brand new website devoteed to people who play the famous
tabletop football game - Subbuteo - in North Wales! If that doesn’t get
your pulse racing, I don’t know what will!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this has been a plan for a while, but only just materialised.
Subbuteo has long been a staple in North East Wales, with Flintshire once
boasting the largest Subbuteo club in the UK, along with several
larger-than-life characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The new era” will begin with the &lt;a href=&quot;/opencup2016/&quot;&gt;Wrexham Open Cup 2016&lt;/a&gt;
which will hopefully become an annual event. Depending on the success of
that venture, we might even expand to having a bit of a North Wales league!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, keep checking this exciting website for more news - or more likely,
stumble upon this website and see news that hasn’t been updated for heaven
knows how long!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may also be the occasional article on here, mostly reproduced from the
club’s contributions to new UK table football magazine ‘Grande Subbuteo’.
Again, it’s quite a treat, I’m sure you’ll agree.&lt;/p&gt;
